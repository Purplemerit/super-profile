8. **[Maintenance](8-MAINTENANCE.md)** - Common tasks and troubleshooting

## Environment Variables

See [`.env.template`](.env.template) for the environment variables format you need to create on your EC2 instance.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16.1.6
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20.x
- **Process Manager**: PM2
- **Web Server**: Nginx
- **Services**: AWS S3, Razorpay, Nodemailer

## Estimated Time

- **First-time deployment**: 30-45 minutes
- **Updates**: 5-10 minutes

## Troubleshooting

**Website not loading after deployment?** See **[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** for detailed debugging steps.

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the **[TROUBLESHOOTING](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** guide first
2. Review application logs: `pm2 logs website-builder`
3. Review Nginx logs: `sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`
4. Check the [Maintenance](8-MAINTENANCE.md) guide for common tasks

## Important Notes

- Minimum recommended instance: **t2.small** (t2.micro may run out of memory during build)
- Make sure to configure **Security Groups** properly (ports 22, 80, 443)
- **Backup your .pem key file** - you cannot download it again
- Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control
- For production, always use **HTTPS** (see Step 7)

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check application status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs website-builder

# Restart application
pm2 restart website-builder

# Restart Nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx

# Check Nginx status
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Remove port 3000 from Security Group after nginx setup
- [ ] Setup SSL certificate (HTTPS)
- [ ] Enable UFW firewall
- [ ] Use strong SSH keys
- [ ] Keep system packages updated
- [ ] Regular backups of application and .env file
